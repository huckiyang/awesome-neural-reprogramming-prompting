# awesome-neural-reprogramming-prompting ![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

A curated list of awesome adversarial reprogramming and input prompting methods for neural networks since 2022.

**News** Dr. Pin-Yu Chen and Huck will give a tutortial on adversarial reprogramming at ICASSP 2022.  

How to **empower frozen large-scale pre-trained models** with reprogramming and prompting toward different applications is the next big challenge of Deep Learning.
